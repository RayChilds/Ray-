#It's interesting. First thought is of course the information of the third door does not change the probability of 
#whether the choice between Door 1 & 2 were correct. But according to Conditional Probability, there is new information
#here that is directly dependent on the new information since choosing the first door. 
#What did strike me as important at first was that he chose the door, maybe pointed to it. Then, the ensuing event 
#was the host's activity to choose another door, I don't know why, for entertainment's sake, to drive up the tension
#of the game. But then it's like, are we presuming he knew which door the car was behind? Is that something
#people know about game shows that I don't? That hosts just know what's going on at all times? Is that important?
#He'd must for this to work, at least I think. I'm more interested in why the host would choose to open up one of the 
#doors. Would he open one up with a car behind it if he knew there was a car behind it? I don't think so. If anything I think I would not have
#understood Bayes' Theorem as well had it not been for this example and the idea of conditional probability, 
#outcomes dependent upon first events providing new information to the puzzle.

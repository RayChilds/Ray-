#It's highly unlikely unless there is some major festival I don't know about that a popular time to get an AirBNB in 
#Amsterdam is Christmas Eve. AirBNB's are people's homes in general so it's a bit strange to imagine them 
#Taking in vactioners during this intimate holiday. Also, if people are visiting family, they'd be at their 
#own homes. I'd say the best way to solve this problem would be to choose a more neutral timeframe with no 
#major holidays if the goal is to find the most popular neighborhoods on a random day of the year and not a special one.

```python
#Extremely problematic time period as the mental health services in New York City
#the day after 9/11 would be heavily, heavily utilized in contrast to a city where the tragedy did not strike. 
#Perhaps the mental health services in San Franscisco would still be higher that day, than any other day, but this
#is a terrible way to get a representive sample of the direct comparisions and contrast of the two cities. Best to 
#change the date to one further from a major tragedy, even to stay away from it during anniversaries of major tragedies.

#Survey taken by University students. The title should be changed to include the specificity of the sample being 
#questioned.
